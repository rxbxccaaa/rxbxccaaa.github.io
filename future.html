                    <h3>High School</h3>
                    <p>After I am finished with middle school I would love to go to Lakewood High. I would want to go to Lakewood Highschool because they have ROTC and I really want to join that class because I know It'll make my father proud because my grandfather was in the marines.</p>

                    <h3>College</h3>
                    <p>After I have graduated from Lakwood Highschool, I am looking forward to going to Long Beach State. I would love to go to Long Beach State because they have a DNP program. The DNP is a practice-oriented doctoral, such as the Doctor of Pharmacy, Doctor of Medicine (MD), Doctor of Optometry, or Doctor of Physical Therapy, in contrast to the research-oriented PhD.  The purposes of the DNP are to develop advanced competencies for increasingly complex practice, faculty, and leadership roles in nursing and to provide an advanced educational credential for those in advanced practice.
