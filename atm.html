                <h2>What is ATM?</h2>
                    <p>ATM is the abbreviation for "Applied Technology Magnet". At Bancroft Middle school, ATM is a 3 year program (6-8 grade). I have been in this program for my full 3 years of middle school and I do not regret it at all.</p>

                    <h3>My 6th Grade Year</h3>
                <p>In 6th grade, I learned everything from the basics of typing professionally to the safety and dangers of the web, basically the basics of computer programs. In the beginning of 6th grade, it was really hard for me to type professionaly without looking at the keyboard. But I caught along and was able to type wonderfully in the first few months of 6th. Now that I am in 8th grade I can type up to 60WPM. </p>

                    <h3>My 7th Grade Year</h3>
                    <p>In the 7th grade, I was introduced to Photoshop and Sketchup. We made various projects in Photoshop and Sketchup. In Photoshop I learned how to cover up little or big things in an image, we also learned how to make a magazine which was very fun. On the other hand, in Sketchup we learned various things. We learned how to build houses and apartments etc. The point of Photoshop and Sketchup is to just get creative.</p>

                    <h3>My 8th Grade Year</h3>
                    <p>Now my 8th grade year isn't quite over yet. But I have still learned a lot of things such as HTML and CSS. Using HTML and CSS, I have created this website. As you can see you can get very creative with the understandings of HTML and CSS, I mean you can make a whole webpage about anything of your liking. </p>
