                <h2>What is ATM?</h2>
                    <p>ATM is the abbreviation for "Applied Technology Magnet". At Bancroft Middle school, ATM is a 3 year program (6-8 grade). I have been in this program for my full 3 years of middle school and I do not regret it at all.</p>

                <h3>In 6th grade, I learned everything from the basics of typing professionally to the safety and dangers of the web. In the beginning of 6th grade, it was really hard for me to type professionaly without looking at the keyboard. But I caught along and was able to type wonderfully in the first few months of 6th. Now that I am in 8th grade I can type up to 60WPM. </h3>
